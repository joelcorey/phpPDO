# Why does this exist? #

This was a code challenge for an application

### Challenge ###

Write a simple Hello World script in php that asks someone their name  
and then saves it to a database. Beware of "Little Bobby Tables".

### Steps taken for solving the challenge ###

* Make a Git repository on BitBucket
* Follow this tutorial to set up: http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-php/connect/
* Adapt this code: http://bobby-tables.com/php

### How do I get set up? ###

* PHP 7 with sqlite enabled
* Once you have Composer - "composer update"
* You may need to change your PATH variable to point at PHP
* "php index.php" 

### Further thoughts ###

This could be improved with a framework like Symfony.
